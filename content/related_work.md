### Link Traversal Query Processing

Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP), is a SPARQL querying paradigm that aims at answering queries by exploring the web using the
follow-your-nose priniple of linked data [](cite:cites hartig2016walking).
The query execution start by the dereferencing of URLs called [seed URLs](cite:cites hartig2016walking), with the purpose of injesting their data inside an internal data source, next new data sources are obtained by recursively dereferencing particular IRIs following a user defined lookup policy called reachability criteria [](cite:cites Hartig2012).

### Adaptative query planing

#### Source selection

#### Caracteristic Set

we are going to refer to shape too in this section or another subsection

We need to determine if we consider it a stream comming or somesort of window in an infinite database let's also reread the section of the book

#### Join ordering

### Federated Query

### Query containment

The query containment (QC) problem has been recognized early as an important problem of theoretical relationnal databases. It consist in determining if a conjecture query Q1
