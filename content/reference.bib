  abstract   = {The query containment problem is a fundamental algorithmic problem in data management. While this problem is well understood under set semantics, it is by far less understood under bag semantics. In particular, it is a long-standing open question whether or not the conjunctive query containment problem under bag semantics is decidable. We unveil tight connections between information theory and the conjunctive query containment under bag semantics. These connections are established using information inequalities, which are considered to be the laws of information theory. Our first main result asserts that deciding the validity of a generalization of information inequalities is many-one equivalent to the restricted case of conjunctive query containment in which the containing query is acyclic; thus, either both these problems are decidable or both are undecidable. Our second main result identifies a new decidable case of the conjunctive query containment problem under bag semantics. Specifically, we give an exponential-time algorithm for conjunctive query containment under bag semantics, provided the containing query is chordal and admits a simple junction tree.},

It can be used to describe the vocabulary and the structure of an RDF graph, and to constrain the admissible properties and values for nodes in that graph. The language defines a typing mechanism called shapes against which nodes of the graph can be checked. It includes an algebraic grouping operator, a choice operator and cardinality constraints for the number of allowed occurrences of a property. Shapes can be combined using Boolean operators, and can use possibly recursive references to other shapes.We describe the syntax of the language and define its semantics. The semantics is proven to be well-defined for schemas that satisfy a reasonable syntactic restriction, namely stratified use of negation and recursion. We present two algorithms for the validation of an RDF graph against a shapes schema. The first algorithm is a direct implementation of the semantics, whereas the second is a non-trivial improvement. We also briefly give implementation guidelines.},

Particularly our procedure considers OPTIONAL query patterns, that turns out to be an important fragment to be studied with schemas. We then show the complexity bounds of our problem with respect to the fragments considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing SPARQL query containment in the presence of ShEx constraints.},

  abstract   = {Static analysis is a fundamental task in query optimization. In this article we study static analysis and optimization techniques for SPARQL, which is the standard language for querying Semantic Web data. Of particular interest for us is the optionality feature in SPARQL. It is crucial in Semantic Web data management, where data sources are inherently incomplete and the user is usually interested in partial answers to queries. This feature is one of the most complicated constructors in SPARQL and also the one that makes this language depart from classical query languages such as relational conjunctive queries. We focus on the class of well-designed SPARQL queries, which has been proposed in the literature as a fragment of the language with good properties regarding query evaluation. We first propose a tree representation for SPARQL queries, called pattern trees, which captures the class of well-designed SPARQL graph patterns. Among other results, we propose several rules that can be used to transform pattern trees into a simple normal form, and study equivalence and containment. We also study the evaluation and enumeration problems for this class of queries.},

  abstract  = {While Linked Data (LD) provides standards for publishing (RDF) and (SPARQL) querying Knowledge Graphs (KGs) on the Web, serving, accessing and processing such open, decentralized KGs is often practically impossible, as query timeouts on publicly available SPARQL endpoints show. Alternative solutions such as Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) attempt to tackle the problem of availability by pushing query processing workload to the client side, but suffer from unnecessary transfer of irrelevant data on complex queries with large intermediate results. In this paper we present smart-KG, a novel approach to share the load between servers and clients, while significantly reducing data transfer volume, by combining TPF with shipping compressed KG partitions. Our evaluations show that smart-KG outperforms state-of-the-art client-side solutions and increases server-side availability towards more cost-effective and balanced hosting of open and decentralized KGs.},

  abstract     = {Query execution over the Web of Linked Data has attracted much attention recently. A particularly interesting approach is link traversal based query execution which proposes to integrate the traversal of data links into the creation of query results. Hence -in contrast to traditional query execution paradigms- this does not assume a fixed set of relevant data sources beforehand; instead, the traversal process discovers data and data sources on the fly and, thus, enables applications to tap the full potential of the Web.While several authors have studied possibilities to implement the idea of link traversal based query execution and to optimize query execution in this context, no work exists that discusses theoretical foundations of the approach in general. Our paper fills this gap.We introduce a well-defined semantics for queries that may be executed using a link traversal based approach. Based on this semantics we formally analyze properties of such queries. In particular, we study the computability of queries as well as the implications of querying a potentially infinite Web of Linked Data. Our results show that query computation in general is not guaranteed to terminate and that for any given query it is undecidable whether the execution terminates. Furthermore, we define an abstract execution model that captures the integration of link traversal into the query execution process. Based on this model we prove the soundness and completeness of link traversal based query execution and analyze an existing implementation approach.},
