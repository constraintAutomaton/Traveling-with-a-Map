\subsection{RDF knowledge graph and SPARQL queries}
Our work focuses on conjunctive and disjunctive queries $Q$ of RDF knowledge graph.
The core element of a SPARQL query and knowledge graph (KG) are respectively the triple pattern and the triple which define at Definition~\ref{def:triplePattern}.

\begin{definition}[Triple pattern and Triple]\label{def:triplePattern}
    A triple pattern $tp = (s_{tp}, p_{tp} , o_{tp})$ is formed by a subject term $s_{tp} \in \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V}$, 
    a property path  $p_{tp}$ as defined by  \citeauthor{Kostylev2015} (Definition 2) and the SPARQL specification (section 18.2).~\sepfootnote{sf:propertyPathAlgebra} 
    and an object term  $o_{tp} \in \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{L} \cup \mathcal{V} \cup \mathcal{B}$.
    Where $\mathcal{I}$, $\mathcal{B}$, $\mathcal{L}$, $\mathcal{V}$ are respectiverly the set of every possible IRI, blank node, literal and variable.
    An RDF triple $t = (s,p,o)$ is similar to a triple pattern, 
    where $s \in s_{tp} \setminus \mathcal{V}$,
    $p \in \mathcal{I}$ and $o \in o_{tp} \setminus \mathcal{V}$
\end{definition}

We also define two access function to get respectively the subject and object of a triple pattern $tp$ or a triple $t$,

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        S: tp \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V} \\
        O: tp \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V}
    \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
\iffalse
We define the basic graph pattern (BGP) of $Q$~\sepfootnote{sf:sparqlSpecification} in Definition~\ref{def:bgp}.
The atomic statement of a BGP is a triple pattern $tp$ defined at Definition~\ref{def:triplePattern}.

\begin{definition}[Triple pattern]\label{def:triplePattern}
    A triple pattern $tp = (s_{tp},p_{tp},o_{tp})$ is formed by a subject term $s_{tp} \in \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V}$, 
    a property path  $p_{tp}$ as defined by  \citeauthor{Kostylev2015} (Definition 2) and the SPARQL specification (section 18.2).~\sepfootnote{sf:propertyPathAlgebra} 
    and an object term  $o_{tp} \in \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{L} \cup \mathcal{V}$ 
    where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of every possible variable. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Property path]\label{def:propertyPath}
   A property path $p_{tp}$~\cite{Kostylev2015} is an expression that describe the route of predicate $p$ from $s_{tp}$ to $o_{tp}$.
   \iffalse
   A property path in $tp$ is defined as follow:
   \begin{equation}
    p_{tp} ::= p \in \mathcal{I} | (p_{tpi}/p_{tpj}) | (p_{tpi}|p_{tpj}) | p_{tpi}* | p_{tpi}+ | p_{tpi}? | !p_{tpi}| p_{tpi}^{-}
   \end{equation}.
   The "$/$" operator chain two property path, the alternative operator "$|$" define a possibility between $p_{tpi}$ and $p_{tpj}$.
   The "$^-$" operator inverse the path from $s_{tp}$ to $o_{tp}$.
   The "$!$" represent the negation of a path $p_{tpi}$ such as $p_{tpi} = \mathcal{I} \setminus p_{tpi}$.
   The "$*$", "$+$" and "$?$", refered to in this paper as \emph{cardinality property paths}, are respectively; the repetition of 0 and more of $p_{tpi}$, 
   the repetition of 1 and more of $p_{tpi}$ and the presence or absence of $p_{tpi}$.
   \fi
\end{definition}

Property paths can be represented in SPARQL algebra as defined by \citeauthor{Kostylev2015} (Definition 2) and the SPARQL specification (section 18.2).~\sepfootnote{sf:propertyPathAlgebra}
Notably, the alternative operator can be interpreted as a union, and the sequence operator as a chain of triple pattern.

\begin{definition}[BGP]\label{def:bgp}
 A BGP $B$ is a set of $tp$, \texttt{OPTIONAL} and \texttt{UNION} (both clause containing a sets of $tp$).
 $tp$ sets can be divided into star pattern $Q_{star}$ defined in Definition~\ref{def:starPattern} in a way 
 that $Q = Q_{star_{i-1}} \bowtie Q_{star_i} \forall i \in S$ given that $S$ is the set of every subject of the $tp$ in the $Q$.
\end{definition}
\fi

Our approach relies on analyzing star patterns and tree star patterns defined in Definition~\ref{def:starPattern}.

\begin{definition}[Tree Star Pattern]\label{def:starPattern}
    We define a star pattern $Q_{star}$ as a set of $tp \in Q$~\cite{Karim2020} with the same subject such that 
    given a builder function 
    \begin{equation}
        BQ_{star}(s) = \{tp_i \in Q| S(tp_i) = s\}
    \end{equation}
    with $s \in \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V}$ then $Q_{star_s} = BQ_{star}(s)$.
    We define a tree star pattern $Q_{starT}$ as the union between a root star pattern $Q_{star_s}$
    and the star patterns having as subject term an object term of another star pattern in $Q_{starT}$.
    We define a function that returns every non-literal object terms of a star pattern
    \begin{equation}
        O_{star}: q \in Q \rightarrow  \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V}
    \end{equation}

    We then define $Q_{starT}$ given a  set of partial tree star patterns $Q_{starPT}$
    \begin{equation}
        Q_{starT} = \bigcup_{q \in Q_{starPT}} q
    \end{equation}
    where $Q_{starPT}$ is formed with a root $Q_{star_s}$ by

    \begin{equation}
            Q_{starPT_i} =
        \begin{cases}
            \{Q_{star_s}\} & \text{if } i = 1 \\
            \{BQ_{star}(o)| o \in \bigcup_{q \in Q_{starPT_{i-1}}} O_{star}(q)\} & \text{if } i>1
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}

    We also define a function returning the subjects of the $Q_{star_s}$ of a $Q_{starT}$
    \begin{equation}
        S_{star}: q \in Q \rightarrow  \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V}
    \end{equation}

    We propose a similar definition for the context of KG where we replace the query $Q$ by a KG $G$ and where the object 
    cannot be a $v \in \mathcal{V}$. 
    We denote this structure a tree star.

\end{definition}

\subsection{Reachability criteria}

\emph{Reachability criteria} are boolean functions ($c_i$) restricting the dereferencing of links from the internal data source of the query engine.
They take as parameters an RDF triple $t$ from an internal triple store, a dereferenceable IRI $iri$ from $t$, and the basic query pattern $B$ from the query~\cite{Hartig2012}.
If $c_i$ returns $true$, the query engine must try to dereference $iri$.
More formally
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reachabilityCriteria}
c_i(t, iri, B) \rightarrow \{\mathrm{true}, \mathrm{false}\}
\end{equation}
.
A query engine dereferencing operation stops when no new $iri$ has to be dereferenced during an iteration of the new triples in the internal triple store.

\subsection{RDF data shapes}
RDF data shapes, similar to data schemas, are constraints applied to RDF graphs.
In our context, shapes specify conditions that tree stars predicate and object terms must respect.
This work proposes an abstract formalization of shapes without distinction between different shape languages.

We define a shape
\begin{equation}
S = (E, op \in \{\mathrm{true},\mathrm{false}\})
\end{equation}

$E = \{e_1, e_2 ..., e_{n}\}$ is a set of $n$ shape expressions $e_i$.
Shape expressions are constraints on the triples of tree star.
$op$ describes whether a shape is open ($\mathrm{true}$) or closed.
Before defining what an open and a close shape means, we define an evaluation function 
$Ve(e, op, G_{starT_i}) \rightarrow \{\mathrm{true}, \mathrm{false} \}$
taking a shape expression $e$, a boolean $op$ to determine if the shape is open or closed, and a tree star $G_{starT_i}$.
$Ve$ determines if $G_{starT_i}$ satisfies $e$.
In a closed shape, every triple in $G_{starT_i}$ must contribute to the validation of $Ve$.
In contrast, for an open shape, $G_{starT_i}$ may contain additional triples that are not involved in the validation of $Ve$.
We define a tuple of constraint
\begin{equation}
    st = (pc_p, oc_f, rs^a_b, n \in \{\mathrm{true}, \mathrm{false}\})
\end{equation}
$pc_p$ and $oc_f$ are respectively constraint,
$sc(G_{starT_i})  \rightarrow \{\mathrm{true}, \mathrm{false}\}$,
on the predicate and the object of a triple in a $G_{starT_i}$.
$pc_p$ evaluates if a predicate term in a triple in a $G_{starT_i}$ is equals to an IRI $p$.
$oc_f$ evaluates if an object term of a triple in a $G_{starT_i}$ validate three possible scenerario defined by $f$.
Either it validate that the object term targeted by $oc_f$ is of an RDF type or satisfy a literal comparison.
Or it validate that a shape defined by $f$ is satisfied given that we consider as a tree shape 
$G_{starT_i}^{\prime}$ where $BQ_{star}(o) \in G_{starT_i}^{\prime}$ and $o$ is the object term of targeted by $oc_f$.
$rs^a_b = \{x \in \mathbb{N}_+ | a < x < b \}$ is a range interpreted by $Ve$ as the number of triples in a tree star that must respect both $pc_p$ and $oc_f$.
$n$ is an indication to $Ve$ when $\mathrm{true}$ that no triple in a $G_{starT_i}$ must respect both $pc_p$ and $oc_f$. 

A shape expression is defined by
\begin{equation}
 e ::= st \mid (e_j|e_k)
\end{equation}
where "$|$" denotes a disjunction between two shape expressions.

For $G$ to satisfy $S$, $G$ has to be analyzed as the union of all its tree stars such that $G = \bigcup_{g \in G_{starT}} g$ where $G_{starT}$ is the set of every tree star in $G$
and each tree star are defined in a way that no $Q_{starPT_i}$ are shared by any $G_{starT_i}$.
$G$ satisfies $S$ is defined by $G \models S \iff Ve(e,G_{starT_i}, op\in S)$  for every $G_{starT_i} \in G$ and every $e \in E$ given $E \in S$.

\subsection{Decentralized Knowledge Graph}
A resource $r_i \in R$ contains a KG $g_i \subseteq G$ and is mapped to an IRI $iri_i$.
We define a decentralized knowledge graph (DKG) as a KG $G$ materialized in a network of resources $R$.
The network forms a graph where the resources $r_i$ are the nodes and the $iri_j \in t \in g$ are directed edges starting from $r_i$ to $r_j$.
$G$ is formed by the union of all the $g \in r$, such that $G = \bigcup_{i=0}^{n}g_i$ given $n$ resources.
