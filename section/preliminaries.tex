\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{RDF knowledge graphs and SPARQL queries}
Our work focuses on conjunctive and disjunctive queries over RDF knowledge graphs~(KG) using the state-of-the-art SPARQL query language~\cite{w3SPARQLQuery}.
The core components of SPARQL queries and of KGs are respectively the triple patterns and the triples defined at Definition~\ref{def:triplePattern} and ~\ref{def:triple}.

\begin{definition}[Triple pattern]\label{def:triplePattern}
    A triple pattern $tp = (s_{tp}, p_{tp}, o_{tp})$ is formed by a subject term $s_{tp} \in \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V}$, 
    a property path  $p_{tp}$ as defined by  \citeauthor{Kostylev2015} (Definition 2) and the SPARQL specification (section 18.2)~\cite{w3SPARQLQuery} 
    and an object term  $o_{tp} \in \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{L} \cup \mathcal{V} \cup \mathcal{B}$.
    Where $\mathcal{I}$, $\mathcal{B}$, $\mathcal{L}$, $\mathcal{V}$ are respectively the set of every possible IRI, blank node, literal and variable.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Triple]\label{def:triple}
    An RDF triple $t = (s,p,o)$ is similar to a triple pattern, 
    where $s \in\mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B}$,
    $p \in \mathcal{I}$ and $o \in \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{L} \cup \mathcal{B}$.
\end{definition}

We also define two access functions to get respectively the subject and object term of a triple pattern $tp$ or a triple $t$ while ignoring literals,

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        S: tp \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V} \\
        O: tp \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \cup \mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{V}
    \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}

\subsection{Reachability Criteria}

Relying on results or the traversal of a large network like the World Wide Web is not feasible for defining completeness in LTQP.
Thus, to formalize the completeness of queries, a link discrimination formalism has been developed called \emph{Reachability criteria}~\cite{Hartig2012}.
Reachability criteria are boolean functions ($c_i$) restricting the dereferencing of links from the internal data source of the query engine.
They take as parameters an RDF triple $t$ from an internal triple store, a dereferenceable IRI $iri$ from $t$, and the query $B$~\cite{Hartig2012}.
If $c_i$ returns $true$, the query engine must try to dereference $iri$.
More formally
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reachabilityCriteria}
c_i(t, iri, B) \rightarrow \{\mathrm{true}, \mathrm{false}\}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Decentralized Knowledge Graph}
We define a decentralized knowledge graph (DKG) as a KG $G$ materialized in a network of resources $R$.
A resource $r_i \in R$ contains a KG $g_i \subseteq G$ and is exposed by IRI $iri_i$ which a mapping can interpret.
The network forms a graph where the resources $r_i$ are the nodes and the $iri_j \in t \in g_i$ are directed edges starting from $r_i$ to $r_j$.
$G$ is formed by the union of all the $g \in r$, such that $G = \bigcup_{i=0}^{n}g_i$ given $n$ resources in the network.
