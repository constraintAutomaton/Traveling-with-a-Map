    % Context     
    Centralization of web information causes legal and ethical problems, particularly in the context of social applications.
    % Need
    A potential technical solution to alleviate this problem is to promote the large-scale publication of decentralized datasets and provide tools to maintain similar querying performance expectations as centralized systems.
    Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP) is a promising paradigm to query networks of descentralized datasets without the need
    to maintain potentially costly and restrictive federations.
    However, this querying paradigm is difficult to use in practice due to its long query execution time and high data usage.
    % Task
    We propose a lightweight, low-maintenance data summary method for decentralized RDF documents called a \emph{Shape Index}.
    This method use RDF data shapes to summarise decentralized RDF datasets with the aim of reducing the search space of traversal queries.
    % Object
    This paper formalizes and evaluates the Shape Index data summarisation approach and a \emph{query-shape containment} problem to detect irrelevant sources during LTQP.
     % Findings
    Shape-based data summarisation can reduce the query execution time and network usage of selective traversal queries.
    Our findings also indicate that the reduction in the number of HTTP requests is linearly correlated for queries benefiting from the shape index, but non-linearly correlated for queries that are significantly negatively affected by this approach.
    The performance gain and low maintenance cost of shape indexes make our approach and algoritm an ideal candidate for selective queries over structured descentlized datasets.
