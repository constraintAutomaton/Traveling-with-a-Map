    % Context     
    Centralization of web information causes legal and ethical problems, especially in the context of social applications.
    % Need
    Large scale decentralizing of datasets offers a potential solution, but maintaining querying performance remains a challenge.
    Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP) supports decentralized querying but is limited by long execution times and high data usage.
    % Task
    This paper presents the Shape Index, a lightweight RDF data summarization method using data shapes to reduce the search space for traversal queries.
    % Object
    This paper formalizes and evaluates the Shape Index data summarisation approach and a \emph{query-shape containment} problem to detect irrelevant sources during LTQP.
    % Findings
    Shape-based data summarisation can reduce the query execution time and network usage of selective traversal queries, even in networks with missing or lower-quality information.
    Shape indexes' performance gain and low maintenance cost make our approach an ideal candidates for selective queries over structured decentralized datasets.
