    % Context
    Centralization of web information causes legal and ethical problems, especially in the context of social applications.
    % Need
    Large scale decentralizing of datasets offers a potential solution, but maintaining query performance remains a challenge.
    Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP) supports decentralized querying in large scale networks but is limited by long execution times and high data usage.
    % Task
    This paper presents the \emph{shape index}, a lightweight RDF data summarization method using RDF data shapes to reduce the search space for traversal queries.
    % Object
    In this work, we formalize and evaluate the shape index data summarisation approach and a \emph{query-shape containment} problem to detect irrelevant sources during LTQP.
    % Findings
    Shape-based data summarisation can reduce the query execution time and network usage of selective queries, even in networks with missing or lower-quality information.
    % Conclusion
    This performance gain, without server involvement during querying, makes our approach ideal for selective queries in structured, decentralized datasets.
