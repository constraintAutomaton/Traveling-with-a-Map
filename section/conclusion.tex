\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this article, we introduced a pruning mechanism for LTQP, extending the concept of reachability criteria and leveraging shape indexes. 
Using the SolidBench benchmark, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of HTTP requests without degrading performance, particularly when queries exploit the structural properties of the dataset.
In the best-case scenario, query execution time improved by up to 7 times, and a previously unexecutable query completed successfully.
On average, performance increased by 1.76 times, although in the worst case, execution time rose by 2.8 times for a query that did not exploit the structure of the network. \rt{But this slower query was the one that was already very fast, right? I'd briefly repeat this here, to nuance it properly.} 
Our method also handles scenarios with partial or reduced shape index information in networks, making it relevant for decentralization efforts that allow third-party clients to efficiently query large, heterogeneous datasets.
The approach imposes minimal overhead on servers, requiring only the serving of small static shape index files. 
\rt{I would add a sentence here explaining that your findings could the Solid ecosystem, and standardization efforts such as the Linked Web Storage WG. By saying that your shape index is a low-cost thing pods can expose, and provide a signficant performance boost for query engines.}
This work opens a new line of research in integrating data models directly into decentralized query execution, particularly for unindexed networks.
Future work could focus on enhancing query planning in LTQP~\cite{taelman2024towards} with RDF data shapes, maintaining and developing shape indexes, and exploring other low-cost, low-maintenance indexing structures.

%\rt{I still have some open questions after reading the full article: What is the impact on server load (CPU usage)? Does adding shapes lead to an increase of that? Because if not, you could conclude here by saying that adding shapes adds significant benefits to the client, with no overhead to the server, except for a (possibly offline) process for shape creation/derivation. Also, does adding shapes influence query result arrival times negatively or positively?}

% CPU load is the only comment that I do not address.
