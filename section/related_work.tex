LTQP is a SPARQL querying paradigm that answers queries by exploring the Web using the follow-your-nose principle~\cite{hartig2016walking}.
The main challenge of LTQP is the Web's open-ended nature leading to large search space.
Completeness in LTQP is defined by the traversal of a well-defined set of links~\cite{Hartig2012}.
The first method employed to define this set was the reachability criteria~\cite{Hartig2012}, which are boolean functions that determine whether a link should be dereferenced.
Building on this, the theoretical query language LDQL~\cite{hartigLDQL} was introduced, separating the traversal definition from the query definition.
Further advancements include the subweb specifications language~\cite{Bogaerts2021LinkTW}, which allows data providers to define how their DKG should be traversed.
These contributions are centered on guiding the engine in selecting links to follow in a discovery process.
However, they do not explicitly address mechanisms for restricting certain links in what we could call a pruning process\rt{That's not entirely accurate. SWSL does pruning as well, but it's more pruning for trust (see the Carol's wrong name for Bob example), while you do pruning based on shapes and the current query. Let's elaborate a bit on this difference here.}.
Link pruning can be very useful to reduce the search domain of queries when information about the data model of DKG is found.
\rt{Emphasize why pruning matters for your work}
\rt{A paragraph/subsection is needed explaining the related work around LTQP in DESPs (contrasting to LTQP in Linked Open Data).}

RDF data shapes are used for validating, describing, and communicating data structures, as well as generating data and driving user interfaces~\cite{Gayo2018a,Gayo2018}.
The two most well known RDF data shape formalisms are SHACL and ShEx.\rt{Cite the specs}
%Both describe RDF data but differ in focus: ShEx emphasizes graph structure, while SHACL targets constraints.
For common use cases, they are equally expressive and interchangeable~\cite{Gayo2018c}.
\rt{The following 4 lines should at least form a separate paragraph.}
Shape Trees~\cite{shapetreesShapeTrees} are an index structure for validating and organizing decentralized knowledge graphs (DKGs).
However, Shape Trees have not been used for query optimization. 
Due to their \emph{virtual hierarchy}~\cite{shapetreesShapeTrees}, it can be challenging for a query engine to efficiently capture the relationship between a resource IRI and its corresponding shapes.
Furthermore, because Shape Trees are not widely adopted, proposing an alternative formalization for query optimization addresses a gap in the literature.\rt{I don't understand this sentence.}
\rt{Contrast shape trees with your shape index approach: how are they different? And why did you introduce something yourself instead of building upon shape trees?}
RDF data shapes have also been used in the literature for querying centralized KGs~\cite{kashif2021}.
Automatic generation of RDF data shapes based on KGs~\cite{fernandez2023extracting} and shape-based integration of data~\cite{LabraGayo2023} are also topics that have been studied and can support shape-based summary approaches for DKGs.
\rt{How does this relate to your work?}

\rt{The following paragraph needs to be better structured. There's a lot of stuff in there, but it's not very coherent. It's introduced as source selection, but that's not accurate, as you mention SERVICE (which is an operator in SPARQL), summarization techniques for query optimization, ... You also mix sparql federation and link traversal. And then you end with some centralized techniques. You may even want to have separate subsections for some of these topics. Also think about what point you want to make for each subsection, and how it relates to your work (and then also make this clear to the reader).}
Source selection is a crucial challenge in decentralized querying.
Approaches like SPARQL \texttt{SERVICE} clauses, service descriptions, basic statistics on triple counts, and histogram methods have been studied~\cite{hose2012towards, Harth2010}.
However, most of those source selection methods face the limitation of assuming a small number of data sources~\cite{Harth2010}, leaving their suitability for LTQP uncertain.
Bloom filters~\cite{dia2018fast} is also a mecanism that has with success for federated DKGs, however in the context of LTQP it has been show that bloom filters have little effect on performances~\cite{Hanski2024}
Schemas-based indexing~\cite{Stuckenschmidt2004} using ontologies has also been explored for source selection of SPARQL queries,
however the proposed approach is sensible to the high reuse of vocabulary terms in RDF~\cite{Harth2010}.
