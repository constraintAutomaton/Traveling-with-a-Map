The publication of open link data has been a growing phenomenon in recent years~\cite{papadaki2018interactive}.
Linked data has the potential to create seamless decentralized databases by defining IRI that can be dereferenced to obtain information about a term.
For example, dereferencing a term representing a user like a WebID~\sepfootnote{sf:webID} can provide the name of the user, among other information, without having 
to store this information locally.
However, regardless of this potential, most SPARQL query processing is effectuated in the context of centralized setups or federations of endpoints.

To take advantage of the potential descriptive power of IRI dereferencing a query paradigm called Link Traversal Query Processing LTQP~\cite{Hartig2012} has been developed.
LTQP consists of recursively dereferencing IRI contained into the internal data source of a query engine 
during its query execution to append its base of information.
A lookup policy can be used to limit the search domain of the query.
LTQP comes with multiple difficulties such as the open endlessness of the web, which can be interpreted as a pseudo-infinite domain of exploration,
and the challenge of creating an efficient query plan due to the lack of information about the data sources. 
It has been demonstrated by ~\citeauthor{hartig2016walking} that in the open web the main performance bottleneck and obstacle for query completeness and fast query execution time is not the query plan but the large number of the HTTP request necessary to fulfill a query.

From another perspective, and not disproving ~\citeauthor{hartig2016walking}, 
~\citeauthor{Taelman2023} has demonstrated that in a Linked Data Structured Environment (LDSE),
it is possible to attain query completeness and query planning can have an influence on the speed of execution.
A LDSE is defined has an RDF environment where in addition to the RDF principles, specifications
guarantee the completeness of results.
This guarantee of completeness has the positive side effect of providing information
that can be used to create a lookup policy following a mix of the reachability criteria method~\cite{Hartig2012, Taelman2023} and the subweb specifications~\cite{Bogaerts2021LinkTW}
to reduce the number of HTTP requests necessary to attain completeness.

In practice LDSE can be use in the context of personal data and social network among others,
an exemple of an environment respecting those constraints is the linked data protocol Solid~\cite{Taelman2023}.
The work of Taelman~\cite{Taelman2023} indicate that there are multiple optimizations possible in LTQP in the context LDSE as opposed to the
more pessimist conclusion of the work of ~\citeauthor{hartig2016walking} (it has to be stressed that it was not in the same context).
This paper position itself has a continuation of the work of Taelman~\cite{Taelman2023} and our previous short contribution on the topic~\cite{tam2024opportunitiesshapebasedoptimizationlink} 
by introducing RDF data shape, a well known and used RDF data quality mechanism, to optimized LTQP query in the context of LDSE.
The conceptual idea of RDF data shape is to describe the properties of an entity;
for instance their class, their cardinality and constraint.
RDF data Shapes have already been used for optimizing the query planning~\cite{kashif2021}
in the context of a single endpoint query,but as far as our knowledge goes, none of the studies have used them in the context of LTQP of LDSE.


More concretely, in this work we present how we can form summaries of descentralized RDF datasets mapping RDF data shapes with RDF ressources and perform 
a query shape containment problem to discriminate irrelevant sources following the reachability criteria paradigm.
We formulated reasearch questions to guide our study:
Can our method reduce the ratio of non-contributing data source dereferenced?
How does the diminution of HTTP request affect the query execution time?
How does the level of detail of the shapes impact the performances?
What is the difference in performance between a\emph{complete} and an \emph{incomplete} shape index?
How does the ratio of subdomains containing an index influence global performances?
How does the fragmentation of the subdomain impact the performance?
How does the quantity of non-query contributing resources impact the performances?
What is the ideal query execution time if we only dereferenced contributing data sources?

The paper is divided as follows, first we present the related work, following by our approach, then the
experimental methodology, the results and discussion and a conclusion.
