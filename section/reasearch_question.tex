\section{Reaseach questions}
In the follow section we are going to formulate our reasearch questions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Can our method reduce the ratio of non-contributing data source dereferenced?
    \item How does the diminution of HTTP request affect the query execution time?
    
    \item How does the level of detail of the shapes impact the performances?
    \item What is the difference in performance between a\emph{complete} and an \emph{incomplete} shape index?
    \item How does the ratio of subdomains containing an index influence global performances?
    \item How does the fragmentation of the subdomain impact the performance?
    
    \item How does the quantity of non-query contributing resources impact the performances?

    \item What is the ideal query execution time if we only dereferenced contributing data sources?
    \item What is the performance of our method compared to a single endpoint solution?
\end{itemize}
