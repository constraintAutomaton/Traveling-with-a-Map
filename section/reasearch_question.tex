\section{Reaseach questions}
In the follow section we are going to formulate our reasearch questions.

\cite{Spasi2023}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can our method reduce the ratio of non-contributing data source dereferenced
    \item What is the ideal query execution time if we only dereferenced contributing data sources
    \item What is the performance of our method compared to a single endpoint solution
    \item How does the level of detail of the shapes impact the performances
    \item What is the difference of performance of a \emph{complete} versus an \emph{incomplete} shape index
    \item How does the ratio of subdomain containing an index influence the global performance
    \item How does the fragmentation of the subdomain impact the performance

\end{itemize}
