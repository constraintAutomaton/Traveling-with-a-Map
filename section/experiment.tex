\subsection{Implementation}
We implemented our approach using the LTQP version of the Comunica query engine~\cite{taelman_iswc_resources_comunica_2018}. 
We chose Comunica for its modularity~\cite{taelman_swj_componentsjs_2022} and its established use in multiple LTQP studies~\cite{Bogaerts2021LinkTW, Taelman2023, eschauzier_quweda_linkqueue_2023, Hanski2024, eschauzier_amw_rcubemetric_2024, tam2024opportunitiesshapebasedoptimizationlink}.
The implementation of our reachability criteria and the link queue filter is open source~\sepfootnote{sf:implementationComunica}, as well as our query-shape containment solver.~\sepfootnote{sf:implementationQueryShapeContainment}

\subsection{Experimental setup}
We use the social benchmark Solidbench~\cite{Taelman2023} which is based on the LDBC benchmark~\cite{Angles2020} to evaluate our contribution.
We created an open source module~\sepfootnote{sf:shapeIndexGenerator} to generate shape indexes in Solidbench based on user-provided mapping between ShEx shapes and data model objects.
Additionally, our module offers the functionality to generate incomplete shape indexes reproducibly using user-defined probability and a random seed.

We design the following experiments to analyze and evaluate our approach:
Evaluation of the execution time and results of our query-shape containment algorithm with the shapes used in the study.
Evaluation of the state-of-the-art traversal algorithm, using the type-index, the LDP specification and type-index, and the LDP specification~\cite{Taelman2023} in relation to our shape index approach in a network where every dataset provides a complete shape index with the most descriptive shapes.
Evaluation of a network where each dataset exposes a shape index where each data model entries are described with a shape. 
There are three experiments: one in which the shapes are the most descriptive, one in which the shapes do not refer to other shapes outside of what is hosted by the dataset, and one in which the shapes provide a minimal description of the data mode.
Evaluation of a network where 0\%, 20\%, 50\%, and 80\% of the network dataset possess a shape index and a similar experiment where the probability is on the completeness of the shape index.
Evaluation of the ratio of query-relevant sources of the shape index and the LDP specification and type-index approaches. 
For did 50 repetition of each experiments with a timeout of 2 minutes (120,000 ms).

To run our experiments we used a machine with the Os Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS with a 2x Hexacore Intel E5645 CPU and 24GB of RAM.
