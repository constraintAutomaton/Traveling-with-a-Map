    \caption{
    Comparison of query execution time with the type index approach.
    The ratio represents how the execution time of each method compares to that of the type index. 
    A ratio greater than $1$ indicates a slower execution time (\textbf{lower is better}).
    The shape index approach performs similarly or better than the other methods, except in the case of S4.
