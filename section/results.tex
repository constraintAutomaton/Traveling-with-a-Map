\section{Results}

The empirical evaluation of the query-containment algorithm shows its execution with the shapes of our experiment is negligible, as presented in table~\ref{tab:queryShapeContainmentEval}.
The execution time for the other shape set is also negligible. Because of space restrictions, we do not include those results, but they are available online.
